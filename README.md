## ðŸ“„ GraphQL Mutation Examples

This repository contains three example GraphQL mutation requests for creating custom QL rules using a GraphQL API.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To use any of the examples provided in this repository, make sure to include the following HTTP header in your requests:

`x-tenant-context: 12345`

Replace `12345` with your actual **tenant ID**.

This header is **required** by the API to properly route and authorize your requests based on your tenant context.
